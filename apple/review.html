<h1>Apple Iphone 7 Reeview on AirPods<h1>  

<p>
The new product Apple has produced this week, the wireless Earpods. This sounds like a great idea because of tangle free problems and not needing of burned out earbuds. However, a lot of problems can occur with these new wireless Earpods. Like it would be easy to misplace them. Also I don’t like how the Earpods looks on both ear without wires. Maybe it’s just me.
